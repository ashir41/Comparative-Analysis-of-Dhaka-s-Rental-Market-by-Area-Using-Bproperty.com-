# Comparative Analysis of Dhakaâ€™s Rental Market

This project analyzes Dhakaâ€™s rental housing market using scraped data. We collected listings for 1â€“5 bedroom apartments for rent in Dhaka from **Bproperty.com**, a leading Bangladeshi real estate portal. Selenium (Python) was used to automate web browsing and extract listing details from dynamic pages. The raw data was saved to an Excel file (`bproperty_rentals_transformed.xlsx`) and then cleaned and analyzed with the Pandas library. Results are presented in an interactive Tableau dashboard (link below) that highlights key metrics and insights.
